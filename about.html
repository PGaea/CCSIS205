  <p>Hi, I’m Princess Gaea T. Butardo, a 3rd Year BSIS student and the developer of this website. Creating this project has been a way for me to apply what I’ve learned in Information Systems while also expressing my passion for technology. As a student leader and aspiring developer, I continue to grow, learn, and explore new ideas that can make a difference.</p>
